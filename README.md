# AirportJS
This is an unfinished game  Airport/Air Traffic Controller game back from 2014. I consider this the first prototype of similar projects I have developed later on.

Built with EaselJS.

I decided to make this a top down 2D game with a tile-system and all gameplay aspects were determined with that idea in mind. This project was ultimately abandoned due to my own lack of experience with javascript at the time. This caused many aspects of programming the functionality (particularly the movements of sprites) to be challenging and ultimately too inefficient to be viable from a personal perspective. However, the project setup and the organization of data used in this project were ultimately positive experiences that helped become the foundation of later works.
