# AirportJS
This is an unfinished game  Airport/Air Traffic Controller game that I've been wanting to create for awhile. 
More info on how to play the game will come as it becomes further developed.

Built via EaselJS in Javascript/HTML.

The design and code for this game is solely my own. 
My inspiration comes mainly from "I am an Air Traffic Controller 3", adding in features that were not present in the original game but I would have liked to see. 
I decided to make this a top down 2D game with a tile-system and all gameplay aspects were determined with that idea in mind.
